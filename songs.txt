And when a little light from Heaven filled my soul
It makes my heart in love and worte my name above
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right.

            (And He will) Answer by and by
            (Now when you) Feel a little bravel turning
            (And you will) Know a little fire�s burning
            (And you will) Find a little talk with Jesus makes it   
             right

No higher than my knee
My mother bought a box of crayons
Just for me.

I picked them up and I open them
And looked way down inside
And the color there reminded me
Of Jesus when He died.

Ch. Red is the color of the blood that He shed
      Brown is the color of thorns they laid upon His head
      Blue is for royalty since Jesus is our king
      Yellow for the streets of
      Gold where Christians sing.

I colored and I colored 
Till the crayons were all gone
And though I am much older now
The memory lingers on.

And when I see a little child
With crayon box in hand
I tell them what they mean to me
And hope they understand

Red is the color of the blood that He shed
Black shows the sins which we do against Him
White is the purity we got by His blood 
Green for the growth of the child of God.

462.

      We come before you rejoicing

      When the world wonders why 
      We�ll just tell them we�re loving our King
      Oh we�ll just tell them we�re loving our King

I bless the Name of the King of Kings

Every dawn is a new sunrise
Every beauty He place near for me

Looking the same as it always has
Birds began to sing their same old song
Notice the due on the leaf and grass
Blossom on the branches of the tree
Then I remembered God made all of this just for me

God of His hands creating
Majesty and all the mountains we cry
His gentle sculpting of the ocean�. And seas
His breath giving life to all mankind
His voice speaking night into day
He ordered again this special gift to me

Oh! Lord my God, When I�m in awesome wonder,
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made,
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

      Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee, 
      How great Thou art, How great Thou art (2)

When through the woods & forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,
When I look down from lofty mountains grandeur,
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in,
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin�Then 

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart,
Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, my God how great Thou Art! ..



515.
God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus, He came to die, 
Heal and forgive, He bled and died, to seal my pardon,          
An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour reigns

           Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
           Because Christ lives, all my fear is gone,
           And because I know Yes I know, He holds my future,  
           And life is worth the living just because He lives.

And then one day, I�ll cross the river,  I�ll fight life�s final 
War with pain, And then as death, gives way to victory,                              
I�ll see the lights of glory And then I�ll know he reigns

How sweet to hold a new born baby
And feel the pride and joy He gives
But greater still the clam assurance, this child can face,
Uncertain days because He lives.



516.
There is a name I love to hear, I love to sing its worth,
It sounds like music in my ear, The sweetest name on earth.

      Oh! How I love Jesus (3)  Because He first loved me.

It tells me of a Savior�s love, Who died to set me free,
It tells me of His precious Blood, The sinner�s perfect plea.

It tells me what my Father hath, In store for every day,
Though I tread a dark-some path, yields sunshine all the way

It tells of One whose loving heart, Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part, That none can bear below.


517.
Tell me the story of Jesus, write on my heart every word!
Tell me story most precious, sweetest that ever was heard
Tell how the angels in chorus, Sang as they welcomed His

Peace and good tidings to earth     .. Tell me the story

Fasting alone in the desert, tell of the days that He passed
How He was tried & was tempted, yet was triumphant at last
Tell of the years of His labours, tell of the sorrows He bore
He was despised & afflicted, homless, rejected & poor �.

Tell of the cross where they nailed Him, Hanging in anguish and pain, Tell of the grave where they laid Him                     Tell how he liveth again Love in that story so tender, Clearer than ever I see, Stay, let me weep while you whisper, 
He paid the ransom for me

A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, A wonderful Savior to 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,                        [me,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

And filled with His goodness divine,  I sing in my rapture,

To meet Him in clouds of the sky,   His perfect salvation, 
His wonderful love, I�ll shout with the million on high.

As we gaze on your kingly brightness, So our faces 
Display your likeness, Ever changing from glory to glory,
Mirrored in our lives tell Your story.. Chorus

Just a closer walk with thee, Grant it Jesus, hear my plea
Daily walking close to thee Let it be, Dear, Lord let it be.

I am weak but thou art strong, Jesus keeps me from all wrong
I�ll be satisfied as long, As I walk let me walk close to thee.

Through this world of toil and snares, If I falter, 
Lord who cares? Who with me my burden shares?  
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

When my feeble life is o�er, Time for me will be no more
On that bright eternal shore, I will walk dear Lord, close to Thee

Let us sing of His love once again, 
Of the love that can never decay,  Of the blood of the Lamb who was slain,  Till we praise Him again in that day.

	In the sweet.. by and by,

There�s cleansing and healing for all 
Who will wash in the life giving blood, There is life everlasting and joy, At the right hand of God through the blood.

Even now while we taste of His love,
We are filled with delight at His Name, But what will it be when above, We shall join in the song of the Lamb.

Oh God our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come
Our shelter from the stormy blast, And our eternal home,

Under the shadow of Thy throne, Thy saints have dwelt secure
Sufficient is Thine arm alone, And our defense is sure

Before the hills in order stood, Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting thou art God, To endless years the same,

A thousand ages in Thy sight, Are like an evening gone,
Short as the watch that ends, The night before the rising sun,

Time, like an ever-rolling steam, Bears all its sons away, They fly, forgotten, as a dream, Dies at the opening day.

O God our help in ages past, Our hope for Years to come,  Be Thou our guard while life shall last,  And our eternal home.

526.
There is a land that is fairer than day, And by faith, 
We can see it afar, For the Father waits over the way, 
To prepare us a dwelling place there

In the sweet by and by, 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore (2)

We shall sing on that beautiful shore, the melodious 
Songs of the blest, And our spirits shall sorrow no more, 
Not sigh for the blessing of rest

To our bountiful, Father above, We will offer
our tribute of praise For the glorious gift of His
love, And the blessings that hallow our days.

527.
Oh! what a wonderful, wonderful day, Day I will never forget,  
After I wandered in darkness away, Jesus my Savior I met
Oh! what a tender compassionate friend, 
He met the need of my heart Shadows dispelling with joy, 
I am telling, He made all my darkness depart!

Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
When at the cross my Savior made me whole
My sins were washed away, And my night was turned to day 
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.

Born of the Spirit with life from above, Into God�s family divine, Justified fully thru Calvary�s love, Oh! What a standing is mine,
And the transaction so quickly was made, When as a sinner
I came, Took of the offer of grace He did proffer,
He saved me Oh!  Praise His dear name.                

Now I�ve a hope that will surely endure, 
After the Passing of time, I have a future in heaven for sure, There in those mansions sublime, And its because of that wonderful day, When at the cross I believed,
Riches eternal and blessings supernal 
From His precious hand I receiv�d

Years I spent in vanity and pride, Caring not my Lord was 
Knowing not it was for me He died, On Calvary         [crucified,

 Chorus  Mercy there was great and Grace was free
               Pardon there was multiplied to me,

Then I trembled at the law I�d spurned
Till my guilty soul imploring turned, To Calvary

Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing, of Calvary

Oh the love that draw salvation�s plan, 
Oh the grace that brought it down to man
O the mighty gulf that God did span, on Calvary

537.
Would you be free from the burden of sin,
There�s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Would you over evil a victory win?
There�s wonderful power in the blood.

    There is pow�r, pow�r, wonder working pow�r,
    In the blood, of the Lamb,   There is pow�r, pow�r, 
    Wonder working power,  In the precious blood of the Lamb.

Would you be free from your passion and pride?
There�s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Come for a cleansing to Calvary�s tide,
There�s wonderful power in the blood �..There�s.

Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?
There�s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Sin stains are lost in its life-giving flow,
There�s wonderful power in the blood� There�s..

Would you do service for Jesus your King?
There�s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Would you live daily His praises to sing?
There�s wonderful power in the blood. .. There�s.

Blessed Saviour  we adore thee, 
We Thy love and grace proclaim,  Thou art Mighty, 
Thou art Holy, Glorious is Thy matchless Name,
 Great Redeemer Lord and master, center of unbroken praise,
 Let the saints of every nation, Sing Thy love & endless grace

Thou art giving and forgiving every blessing every blest; 
Well spring of the joy of living, Ocean depth of happy rest! Thou our Father Christ our brother, all who live in love are Thine
Teach us how to love each other, Lift us to the joy divine

What can wash away my stain? 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
What can make me whole again? 
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

   Oh! Precious is the flow, That makes me white as snow!
    No other fount I know, Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

For my cleansing this I see, Nothing �..
For my pardon this my plea, Nothing � 

Nothing can for sin atone - Nothing �..
Naught of good that I have done - Nothing ..

This is all my hope and peace - Nothing �.
This is all my righteousness - Nothing �..

540.
My Hope is built on nothing less, 
Than Jesus� blood and righteousness; I dare not trust the sweetest frame, But wholly lean on Jesus� Name,

 On Christ the Solid Rock I stand, 
     All other ground is sinking sand, (2).

When darkness seems to veils His face, 
I rest on His unchanging grace,
In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant His blood, 
Support me in the �whelming flood;  When all around my 
Soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound, 
Oh may I then in Him be found,  Dressed in His 
Righteousness alone, Faultless to stand before the throne.

541.
Fairest of all the earth beside, Chiefest of all unto thy bride, Fullness divine, in Thee I see, Wonderful man of Calvary

Chorus:  That man of Calvary, Has won my heart from me,
               And died to set me free, Blest man of Calvary.

Granting the sinner life and peace, Granting the captive Sweet release, Shedding His blood to make us free, 
Merciful man of Calvary .. .. Cho.

Giving the gift obtained from men, Pouring out love beyond our 
Giving us spotless purity, Bountiful man of Calvary.�       [ken

Lo, He comes with clouds descending, 
Once for favored Sinners slain,   Thousand, thousand saints,                               Attending sweet the triumph of His train
  Halleluiah (3) God appears on earth to reign.           

Every eye shall now behold Him, robed in glorious Majesty,
Those who set at naught and sold Him, Pierced & nail Him to
Deeply wailing (3) shall their true Messiah see            [the tree

Those dear token of His passion, still his dazzling body bears,
Cause of endless exultation, to His ransomed worshippers
With what rapture, (3), gaze we on those glorious scars.

Yea, Amen, let all adore Thee, high on Thine eternal throne,
Saviour take the power & glory, claim the kingdom for thine 
Come, Lord Jesus!  Everlasting God, come down!           [own

Meekness & majesty, Manhood & Deity, in perfect harmony,
The Man who is God, Lord of Eternity, Dwells in humanity,
Kneels in humility and washes our feet.

       Oh What a mystery, meekness & majesty, Bow down
	And worship for this is your God, this is your God.

Father�s pure radiance, perfect in innocence 
Yet learns obedience to death on a cross, 
suffering to give us life, Conquering through
Sacrifice, And as they crucify, Prays: �Father forgive�.

Wisdom unreachable, God the invisible, Love indestructible,
In frailty appears, Lord of infinity, Stooping so tenderly,
Lifts our humanity to the heights of His throne.

544.
All to Jesus I surrender, All to Him I freely give, 
I will ever love and trust Him, In His presence daily live 

     I surrender all (2) All to Thee my  
     Blessed Saviour I surrender all

All to Jesus I surrender, Humbly at His feet I bow, 
Worldly pleasures all forsaken, take me Jesus take me now 

All to Jesus I surrender, Make me Saviour wholly Thine, 
Let the Holy Spirit witness, I am Thine and Thou are mine 

All to Jesus I surrender, Lord I give myself to Thee, Fill me
with Thy love and Power, Let Thy blessing rest on me.. Ch

All to Jesus I surrender, Now I feel the sacred flame, 
Oh! The joy of full salvation, Glory glory to His Name .. Ch

Down the mountain the river flows, 
And it brings refreshing wherever it goes,
Through the valleys and over the fields,
The river is rushing and the river is here.
  
   The river of God sets our feet to dancing,
   The river of God fills our hertz with cheer,
   The river of God fills our mouths with laughter
   And we rejoice for the river is here.

The river of God is teaming with life, 
And all who touch it can be revived,
And all who linger on this river shore,                                  
Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord 

Upto the mountain we love to go,  To find the 
Presence of the Lord, Along the Banks of The river we run, 
We dance with laughter, Giving praise to the Son � 

546.
Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing pow�r? 
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting in His grave this hour? 
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
 
 Are you washed, in the blood?
	 In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb?
	 Are your garments spotless, Are they white as   
        snow?
	 Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?

Are you walking daily by the Savior�s side? 
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
Do you rest each moment in the crucified? Are you �

When the bridegroom cometh will you robes be white? 
Pure and white in the blood of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright? 
And be washed in the blood of the lamb?

Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin, 
And be washed in the blood of the lamb?
There�s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean, 
Oh! Be washed in the blood of the lamb?

547.
Praise Him, Praise Him Jesus our blessed Redeemer
Sing Oh! Earth His wonderful love proclaim,
Hail Him, Hail Him, Highest Archangels in glory,
Strength and honour give to His holy name.
   Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children
   In His arms He carries them all day long,
   Praise Him, Praise Him! Tell of His excellent greatness,
   Praise Him, Praise Him! Ever in joyful song.    

Praise Him, Praise Him Jesus our blessed Redeemer
For our sins He suffered and bled and died;
He, our rock, our hope of eternal salvation;
Hail Him, hail Him, Jesus the Crucified,
   Loving Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow,
   Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow;
   Once for us rejected, despised and forsaken,
   Prince of Glory, ever triumphant now.

Praise Him, Praise Him!  Jesus our blessed Redeemer,
Heavenly portals, loud with Hosannas ring!
Jesus, Saviour, reigneth forever and ever,
Crown Him, Crown Him! Prophet and priest and King
Death is vanquished! Tell it with joy, ye  faithful
Where is now thy victory, boasting grave?
Jesus lives!  No longer thy portals are cheerless
Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save. 

548.
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus, sing His mercy & His grace,
In the mansion bright and blessed, He�ll prepare for us a place

  When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will 
  When we all see Jesus, We�ll sing &  shout the victory.   [be!   

While we walk the pilgrim pathway 
Clouds will over spread the sky,  But
when traveling days are over, not a shadow not a sigh� Chor

Le t us then be true and faithful, Trusting serving every day, 
Just one glimpse of Him in glory Will the toils of life repay�

Onward to the prize before us!  Soon his beauty we�ll behold; 
Soon the pearly gates will open we shall tread the streets of gold

549.
Angels never knew the joy that is mine,
For the blood has never washed their sins away, 
For they sing in heaven, There would come a time, 
When silently They listen to me sing, amazing grace.

Oh! It�s a song holy angels cannot sing, Amazing grace 
How sweet the sound, Oh! It�s a song holy angels cannot sing, 
I once was lost but now I am found.

And holy is the Lord the angels sing, 
For around the Throne of God continually, 
For they sing in heaven, There would come a time,                    
When silently they listen to me sing, amazing grace.

Rescue the perishing care for the dying, Snatch them in pity From sin and the grace, Weep over the erring one, 
Lift up the fallen, Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.

    Rescue the perishing, care for the dying, 
    Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting, 
Waiting the penitent child to receive, 
Plead with the earnestly,  Plead with them gently, 
He will forgive, if they only believe.

Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter, 
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore, 
Touched by a loving heart, Wakened by kind-ness, 
Cords that are broken will vibrate once more.

Rescue the perishing duty demands it, 
Strength for thy labour, The Lord will provide, 
Back to the narrow way Patiently win them,
Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died.


551.
Nearer my God to Thee, Nearer to Thee,
Even though it be a Cross that raiseth me,
Still all my songs shall be, Nearer my God to Thee,
Nearer my God to Thee, Nearer to Thee.

Though like a wanderer, the sun gone down, 
Darkness comes over me, My rest a stone, 
Yet in my dreams I�d be, Nearer my God to �..

There let my way appear, Steps unto heaven, All that thou sendest me, In mercy given, Angels to beckon me, Nearer �

Then with my waking thoughts, bright with Thy praise, 
Out of my stony griefs, Bethel I raise, So by my woes to be �

Or if on joyful wings, cleaving the sky,  Sun, moon and starts Forget, Upward I fly, Still all my song shall be, Nearer �..

552.  
Here is a song for the man Who walked on the waters
Here is a song for the man Who calmed the sea,
Here is a song for the man Who died for you and me,
Here is a song for the man Of Galilee.

Many songs today we hear about a Saviour,
And there are many songs, Who talk about the way, 
If you listen to the song You will find the answer,
For Jesus is the Truth, the Life and the Way.

This song I sing now is for the Lord of glory, Risen from the dead and exalted over all,  Repent of sins and say Lord 
�I am sorry� His Spirit I�ll reveal a  way to trumpet call.
553.  
To God be the glory! Great things He hath done,
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
And opened the Life-gate that all may go in,

       Praise the Lord (2)  Let the earth hear His voice,
       Praise the Lord (2)  Let the people rejoice,
       Oh! come to the Father through Jesus the Son,
       And give Him the glory great things He hath done.

Oh! Perfect redemption, the purchase of blood, 
To every believer the promise of God,
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives��

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son,   
But purer, and higher and greater will be,
Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see�..


554.
All hail the power of Jesus� name, Let angels prostrate fall, Bring forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all.

Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God, Who from His alter call, 
Extol the Stem of Jesse�s rod, And crown Him Lord of all.

Sinners! whose love can ne�er forget, the wormwood & the gal; Go spread your Trophies at His feet, And crown Him Lord of all

Ye saints redeemed of Adam�s race, ye ransomed from the fall
Hail Him who saves you by His grace, &crown Him Lord of all.

Let every kindred, Every tribe, On this terrestrial ball, 
To Him all majesty ascribe, And crown Him Lord of all.

Oh! That with yonder sacred throng, We at His feet may fall,
Join in the everlasting song, And crown Him Lord of all.

555.
Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty, 
Early in the Morning, Our song shall rise to Thee 
Holy, Holy, Holy! Merciful and Mighty! 
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity.

Holy, Holy, Holy! All the saints adore Thee, 
Casting down their Golden Crown around the glassy Sea;
Cherubim and Seraphim falling down before Thee,
Who wert, and art, and evermore shall  be.

Holy, Holy, Holy! Though the darkness hide Thee, 
Though the eye of sinful man , Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art Holy, there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power, in love, and purity.


Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty, 
All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth and sky and sea,
Holy, Holy, Holy, Merciful and Mighty! 
God in three persons, blessed Trinity.

556.
I will sing of my Redeemer, And His wondrous love to me,
On the cruel cross He suffered, From the curse to set me free.
  
     Sing oh! Sing of my Redeemer, 
     With His blood He purchased me, On the cross He
     Sealed my pardon,  Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story, How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy, He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer, His triumphant power I�ll tell;
How the victory He giveth us, Over sin, and death, and hell.

I will sing of my Redeemer, And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life has brought me, Son of God with Him to be

557.
Would you like to change your life today, 
And live for God each day, 
There is always danger in today, will you live for God today.

  Chor.:  Will you live, (2) Will you live for God today (2)

You can have the Saviour every day, will you live for God 
Jesus Christ has given His life for you,                     [today,
Will you live for Him always�

You can leave you sins at Jesus� feet, And live for God today,
He will forgive your sins and sets you free, Will you live � ..

He leadeth me! Oh! Blessed thought, 
Oh! Words with heavenly comfort fraught,  Whate�er I do, Where�er I be, Still �tis God�s hand that leadeth me.

 He leadeth me! (2) By His own hand He leadeth me,  
 His faithful follower I would be, For by His hand He leadeth me

Sometimes �mid scenes of deepest gloom, 
Sometimes where Eden�s bowers bloom, By waters 
Still o�er troubled sea, Still �tis His hand that leadeth me.

Lord I would clasp Thy hand in mine, 
Nor ever murmur or repine, Content, whatever lot I see, 
Since �tis my God that leadeth me.

And when my task on earth is done, When by Thy grace, 
The vict�ry�s won; E�en death�s cold wave I will not flee, 
Since Thou through Jordan leadeth me

559.
Come let us sing the matchless worth, 
And sweetly sound the glories forth, which in the 
Saviour shine: o God and Christ our praises bring, 
The son with which the heaven�s ring, Now let us gladly join.

How rich the precious blood He spilt, 
Our ransom from the dreadful guilt of sin against our God,
How perfect is His righteousness, In which unsupported Beauteous dress, His saints have always stood!

Great are the offices He bears,
And bright His characters appears, Exalted on the throne,
In sons of sweet untiring praise, We would, 
To everlasting days,  Make all His glories known.

And soon the happy day shall come,
When we shall reach our destined home & see Him face to 
Then with our Saviour, Master, Friend,                        [face.
The glad eternity we�ll spend, And celebrate His grace.

560.  
In the name of Jesus, Every knee shall bow, 
Every tongue confess Him, King of glory now, 
�Tis Father�s pleasure, We should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning was the mighty Word.

Humbled for a season, To receive a name, 
From the lips of sinners, Unto whom He come, 
Faithfully He bore it, Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious, When from death He passed

Bore it up triumphant, With its human light, 
Through all ranks of creatures, To the central height, 
To the throne of Godhead, To the father�s breast,
Filled it with the glory of that perfect rest.


Name Him brothers name Him, strong your love as death
But with awe & wonder, &  with bated breath,    
He is God the Saviour, He is Christ the Lord, 
Ever to be worshipped, Trusted and adored.

In your hearts enthrone Him, There let Him subdue, 
All that is not holy, All that is not true, 
Crown Him as your Captain, In temptation�s hour,
Let His will enfold you, In its light and power.

Brothers, this Lord Jesus shall return again, 
With His Father�s glory, With His angels train, 
For all wreaths of empire Meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him King of glory now.

561. 
When we walk with the Lord, In the light of His word,
What a glory He sheds on our way, While we do His good will, He abides with us still, And with all who will trust and obey.

    Trust and obey, for there�s no other way,
    To be happy in Jesus, but to trust & obey.

Not a shadow can rise, Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away, Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh or a tear, Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear, Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay,  Not a grief or a loss, 
Not a frown or a cross, But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove, the delights of His love,
Until all on the altar we lay.  For the favour He shows, 
And the joy He bestows, Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet, We will sit at His feet, 
Or we�ll walk by His side in the way; What he says we will do Where He sends, We will go, Never fear, only trust and obey.

562. 
Far above all is our Saviour enthroned, 
Crown�d is the Lamb who for sinners atoned, Living for ever To list to our call, God hath exalted Him far above all.

        Far above all!  (2)  Jesus the crucified far above all!
        Low at His footstool adoring we fall,
        God hath exalted Him far above all.

When the fierce tempest, uplifting its waves, 
Seeks to engulf us, we cry and He saves,  Looking to Jesus, upheld by His hand, Tread we the billows as safe as on land.

High are the cities that dare our assault,
Strong are the barriers that call us to halt, 
March we on fearless, And down they must fall, 
Vanquish�d by faith in Him far above all.
His is the kingdom from pole unto pole,
Far above all while the ages shall roll, With Him the victors, Who follow�d His call, Share in His royalty far above all.

563.
�Man of sorrows!� what a name, for the son of God who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim! Halleluiah! What a Saviour

Bearing shame and scoffing rude, 
In my place condemned He stood,           
Sealed my pardon with His blood, Halleluiah! What a Saviour!

Guilty, vile, and helpless, we: Spotless Lamb of God was he:
Full atonement, can it be?  Halleluiah! �.

Lifted up was He to die, it�s finished! was His cry
Now in heaven exalted high: Halleluiah! �

When he comes our glorious King, All His ransomed home to 
The anew this song we�ll sing: �Halleluiah! �.              [bring,
                                                                                                             
564.
Come let us join our cheerful songs, 
With angels round the throne,  Ten thousand
Thousand are their tongues, But all their joys are one.

Worthy the Lamb that died, they cry,  To be exalted thus; Worthy the Lamb, Our hearts reply, For He was slain for us.

Jesus is worthy to receive, Honour and power divine; And
Blessings more than We can give, be Lord, forever Thine.

Let all that dwell above the sky, And air and earth and seas,  Conspire to lift Thy glories high & speak Thine endless praise

The whole creation join in one, To bless the sacred name, 
Of Him that sits upon the throne, And to adore the Lamb.                                

565. 
This world is not my home, I�m just  a passing through, My treasures are laid up, somewhere beyond the blue The angels beacon me, From heaven�s open door, 
And I can�t feel at home, in this world any more.

Oh! Lord, you know I have no friend like you,
If heaven�s not my home then Lord what will I do?  
The angels beacon me, from heaven�s open door, 
And I can�t feel at home, In this world any more.

I have a loving Father just over in glory land,
And I don�t expect to stop, until I shake His hands, 
He is waiting now for me in heaven�s open door,  
And I can�t feel at home, In this world any more.

Just over in glory land we�ll live eternally,
The saints on every land are shouting victory,
Their songs sweetest praise, Drift back from heaven�s door,              
And I can�t feel at home, in this world any more

566. 
King of my life I crown Thee now, Thine shall the glory be,
Lest I forget Thy thorn crowned brow, Lead me to Calvary.

   Lest I forget Gathsamane, Lest I forget Thine Agony,
   Lest I forget Thy love for me, Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid, 
Tenderly mourned and wept,  Angels in robes of light arrayed, 
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me like Mary through the gloom, Come with a gift to Thee, 
Show to me now the empty tomb, Lead me to Calvary.                                              

May I be willing Lord to bear, Daily my cross for Thee,
Even Thy cup of grief to share, Thou hast borne all for me.

567.
Pass me not a gentle Saviour, Hear my humble cry; 
While on others Thou are calling, Do not pas me by.

   Saviour, Saviour! Hear my humble cry, 
   And while others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.

Let me at the throne of mercy, Find a sweet relief; 
As I kneel in deep constriction, Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit, Would I seek Thy face; Heal my wounded, broken spirit, Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the spring of all my comfort, More than life to me;  Whom have I on earth beside Thee? 
Whom in heaven but Thee.

568.
Jesus our Lord with what joy we adore Thee, 
Chanting our praise to Thyself on the throne!
Blest in Thy presence we worship before Thee,
Own Thou art worthy and worthy along.

      Lord Thou art worthy, Lord Thou art worthy,
      Lord Thou art worthy and Worthy alone,
      Blest in Thy presence we worship before Thee,
      Own Thou art worthy and worthy along.

Verily God, yet become truly human- 
Lower than angels to die in our stead
How hast Thou long promised seed of the woman,                     
Trod on the serpent and bruised His head.

How didst Thou humble Thyself to be taken, 
Lead by Thy creatures and nailed to the Cross,                      
Hated of man, and of God, too forsaken, 
Shunning not darkness, the curse and the loss!

How hast Thou triumphed and triumphed with glory,
Battled death�s forces, rolled back every wave!                       
Can we refrain, then, from telling the story? 
Lord Thou art Victor o�er death and the grave

569.  
According to Thy gracious Word, In meek humility, 
This will I do, oh! Christ my Lord, I will remember Thee

Thy body, broken for my sake, my bread from heaven shall be Thy testamental cup I take, And thus remember Thee.

Gathsamane can I forget? Or there Thy conflict see, 
Thine agony and blood-like sweat, and not remember Thee?

When to the Cross I turn mine eyes, And rest on Calvary, 
Oh! Lamb of God My Sacrifice, I must remember Thee.

Remember Thee, and all Thy pains, And all Thy love to me: Yea, while a breath, A pulse remains, Will I remember Thee.

570. 
Low in the grave He lay, Jesus my Saviour!
Waiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord!

    Up from the grace He arose, With a mighty triumph 
   O�er His foes, He arose a Victor from the dark domine,
    And He lives forever with His saints          
    He arose! (2) Haleluyya! Christ Arose!                                         

Vainly they watch His bed, Jesus, my Saviour!
Vainly they seal the dead, Jesus, my Lord!

Death cannot keep his prey, Jesus, my Saviour!
He tore the bars away, Jesus my Lord!
571.
When I survey the wondrous cross, On which the prince of glory died,  My richest gain I count but loss, 
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it Lord that I should boast, Save in the cross of 
Christ my God, All the vain things that charm me most, 
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See from His head, His hands, His feet, Sorrow and love
Flow mingled down, Did e�er such love and sorrow meet, 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown.

His dying crimson like a robe, spread o�er His body on the tree, Then am I dead to al the globe & all the globe is dead to me.

Were the whole realms of nature mine, 
That were an offering far too small,
Love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life my all.

572.
Oh! Come all yee faithful, Joyful and triumphant, 
Come yee, Oh! Come yee to Bethlehem, 
Come and Behold Him, Born the King of Angels, 
Oh! Come let us adore Him (3) Christ the Lord.

True God of True God, Light of Light eternal, 
Lo! He abhors not the Virgin�s womb, 
Son of the Father Begotten not created, Oh come �

Sing choirs of Angels, Sing in exultation, Sing all yee Citizens of heaven above, Glory to God, Glory in highest, Oh! Come ..

Yea, Lord we greet Thee, Born in the happy morning,
Jesus to Thee be glory given, Word of the Father, 
Now in flesh appearing, Oh! Come let us �.

573.
Alas! And did my Saviour bleed? And did my Sov�reign die?  Would He devote that sacred head For such a worm as I?

   At the cross, At the cross, where I first saw the light,
   And the burden of my heart rolled away, It was there by faith
   I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day.

Was it for crimes that I have done, He groaned upon the tree? Amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide, And shut his glories in, When Christ the mighty maker died for man the creature�s sin

Thus might I hide my blushing face, while His dear cross appears
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, And melt my eyes to tears

But drops of grief can ne�er repay,  The debt of love I owe; Here, Lord I give myself away, It�s all that I can do!

574.
Rock of ages cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee,  
Let the water & the blood, From Thy riven side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure, Cleanse me from its guilt & power.

Not the labour of my hands, Can fulfill Thy law�s demands; 
Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears for ever flow, All for sin could not atone; Thou must save and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Thy cross I cling; Naked, come to Thee for dress, Helpless, look to Thee for grace, Foul, I to the fountain fly, Wash me, Saviour or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath, 
When mine eyes shall close in death, When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgement throne;                     
Rock of ages cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.

575.
Tell me the old old story, Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory, Of Jesus and His love.
Tell me the story simply, as to a little child,
For I am weak & weary & helpless & defiled.

      Tell me the old, old story f Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story slowly, that I may take it in,
That wonderful redemption, God�s remedy for sin,
Tell me the story often, for I forget so soon,
The �early dew� of morning has passed away at noon

Tell me the story softly with earnest tones and grave, Remember! I�m the sinner, Whom Jesus came to save
Tell me that story always, if you would really be,
In any time of trouble, a comforter to me.

Tell me the same Old story, When you have cause to fear,
That this world�s empty glory is costing me too far.
Yes and when that world�s glory, Is dawning on my soul, 
Tell me the old old story, �Christ Jesus makes Thee whole.�


576.
Blessed assurance Jesus is mine, 
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine, Hair of salvation, purchase of God, Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

     This is my story, This is my song,    
      Praising my Saviour All the day long

Perfect submission, perfect delight, Vision of rapture 
Now burst on my sight, Angels descending, 
Bring from above, Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest, 
I in my Saviour am happy and blest; Watching & waiting looking above, Filed with His goodness lost in His love

577.
In tenderness he sought me,  weary and sick with sin,
And on His shoulders brought me Back to His fold again,
While angels in His presence stand, 
Until the courts of heaven rand.

    Oh! the love that sought me, Oh! the blood that bought me,
    Oh! The grace that brought me to the fold, 
    Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold.

He wash�d the bleeding sin wounds & pour�d in oil & the wine, 
He whispered to assure me, I�ve found thee, Thou art mine;  
I never heard a sweeter voice, It made my aching heart rejoice

He pointed to the nail prints, For me His blood was shed,
A mocking crown so thorny, Was placed upon His head,
I wonder�d what He saw in me, to suffer such deep agony

I�m sitting in His presence, Thus sunshine of His face, 
While with adoring wonder, His blessings I retrace, 
It seems as if eternal days are far too short to sound His praise

So while the hours are passing, All now is perfect rest, 
I�m waiting for the morning, The brightest and the best, When
He will call us to His side, To be with Him, His spotless bride.


578.
The great Physician now is near, The sympathizing Jesus; 
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer, 
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus.

    Sweetest note in seraph song,  
    Sweetest name on mortal tongue, 
    Sweetest Carol ever sung,   Jesus blessed, Jesus.

Your many sins are all forgiven, Oh, hear the voice of Jesus, Go on your way in peace to  heaven,
And wear a crown with Jesus.        

All glory to the risen Lamb! I now believe in Jesus,
I love the blessed Savior�s name, I love the name of Jesus.

His name dispels my guilt and fear, No other name but Jesus, O! How my soul delights to hear, the precious name of Jesus

And when to the bright world above, we rise to see our Jesus, 
We�ll sing around the throne of Love, 
His name the name of Jesus.

579.
I will sing the wondrous story, Of the Christ who died for me;  
How He left His Home in glory, For the cross on Calvary.

Yes I�ll sing the wondrous story, of the Christ who died for me
Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.
I was lost; but Jesus found me, 
Found the Sheep that went astray, threw His loving 
Arms around me, Drew me back in to His way.

I was bruised; but Jesus healed me, 
Faint was I from many a fall; Sight was gone, 
and fears Possessed me, But He freed me from them all.

Days of darkness still come o�er me; 
Sorrow�s paths I often tread, But the Saviour 
Still is with me, By His hand I�m safely led.

He will keep me till the river, Rolls its waters at my feet; 
Then He�ll bear me safely over, 
Where he loved ones I shall meet.

580.
Just as I am, without one plea, But that Thy blood was 
Shed for me, And that Thou bid�st me come to Thee, 
Oh! Lamb of God I come, I come.

Just as I am, and waiting not, To rid my soul of one dark blot;            
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, Oh! Lamb of�

Just as I am, though tossed about, With many a conflict, many a doubt, Fighting within And fears without, Oh! Lamb of �..

Just as I am poor, wretched blind, Sight riches healing of the mind,
Yea all I need in The to find, Oh! Lamb of God �..       

Just as I am Thou wilt receive, wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse relieve, 
Because Thy promise I believe, O! Lamb ��.           

Just as I am, Thy love unknown, has broken every barriers down;
Now to be Thine yea, Thine alone, Oh! Lamb of �..  

581.
Down at the cross where my Saviour died, 
Down where for cleansing form sin I cried, 
There to my heart was the blood applied, Glory to His name!  

    Glory to His name, glory to His name, 
    There to my heart was the blood applied, glory to His name!

I am so wondrously saved from sin, 
Jesus so sweetly abides within, There at the Cross 
Where He took me in, Glory to His name.

Oh! Precious fountain that saves form sin, 
I am so glad I have entered in; There Jesus saves me 
And keeps me clean, Glory to His name!

Come to this fountain so rich & sweet, 
Cast your poor soul at the Savior�s feet, Plunge in today 
And be made complete, Glory to His name.

582.
Come Thou Fount of every blessing, Tune my heart To sing Thy grace, Steams of mercy never ceasing, Call for songs of loudest praise, Teach me some melodious sonnets, 
Sung by flaming tongues above, Oh! The vast, 
The boundless treasure, Of my Lord�s unchanging love!

Hear I raise my Ebenezer, Hither by Thy Help I�m come, 
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home. Jesus sought me when a stranger 
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger, interposed His precious blood.

Oh! To grace how great a debtor, Daily I�m Constrained to be! 
Let Thy grace Lord like a fetter bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love, Take my heart, Oh! Take &  seal it, seal it for Thy courts above

583.
The Lord�s my shepherd, I�ll not want, 
He makes me down to lie, In pastures green; 
He leadeth me, The quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again, And me to walk doth make,
Within the paths of righteousness, 
E�en for His own name�s sake.

Yea, though I walk in death�s dark vale, Yet will I fear no evil, For Thou art with me and Thy rod and staff they comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnished, In presence of my foes; 
My head Thou dost With oil anoint, And my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life, Shall surely follow me,
And in God�s house for evermore, my dwelling place shall be.

584. 
The love that Jesus had for me, To suffer on the cruel tree, 
That I a ransomed soul might be, Is more than tongue can tell

    His love is more than tongue can tell (2)
    The love that Jesus had for me, 
    Is more than tongue can tell!

The bitter sorrow that he bore, 
And oh! That crown of thorns He wore
That I might live for evermore, Is more than tongue can tell!

The peace I have in Him, my Lord, 
Who pleads before the Throne of God
The merit of His precious blood, Is more than tongue can tell!

The joy that comes when He I near, 
The rest He gives, so free form fear,  The hope in Him, 
So bright & clear, Is more than tongue can tell!

585.
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, 
That saved a Wretch like me,
I once was lost, but now am found;  Was blind but now I see.

�Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, 
And grace My fears relieved, 
How precious did that grace appear, the hour I first believed.                                 

Through many a dangers, Toils & snares, 
I have already come, �Tis grace that brought me Safe thus far, And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me, His word my hope secures  He will my shield and portion be, As long as life endures,

Yes when this heart and flesh shall fail, And mortal life shall cease, I shall possess within the Vail, A life of joy and peace,

When we�ve been there a thousand years, 
Bright shining as the sun, We�ve no less days to 
Sing God�s praise, Than when we first begun.

586.
Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness, 
Sowing in the noon tide and the dewy eves, 
Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping -

   We shall come rejoicing, Bringing in the sheaves!
    Bringing in the Sheaves (2) We shall come
    Rejoicing bringing in the sheaves! (2)

Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,  
Fearing neither clouds nor winter�s chilling breeze,   
By and by the harvest, and the labour ended, We �

Go then ever, weeping, sowing for the Master, 
Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves,  
When our weeping�s over, he will bid us welcome,  

587.
Jesus keep me near the cross, There a precious fountain, 
Free to all a healing stream, Flows from Calvary�s mountain,

   In the cross (2) be my glory ever;
  Till my ruptured soul shall find,  Rest beyond the river.

Near the cross, a trembling soul. Love and mercy found me, 
There the bright and morning star, shed its beams around me.

Near the cross, Oh! Lamb of God,  Bring its scenes before me; Help me walk from day to day, With  its shadow o�er me.

Near the cross I�ll watch and wait, Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand, Just beyond the river.

588.
When peace like a river attendeth my way, 
When sorrows like sea billows roll;  Whatever my lot 
Thou hast taught me to say, It is well, it is well with my soul!

 Ch.:  It is well, with my soul! It is well, it is well with my soul!

Tho� Satan should buffet,  Tho� trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,          
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, 
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin-Oh! The bliss of this glorious thought, 
My sin not in part, But the whole, is nailed to His cross, 
And I bear it no more, Praise the Lord (2) Oh! My Soul.

For me, be it  Christ, be it Christ hence to live, 
If Jordan above me shall roll, No pang shall be mine, 
For in death as in life, Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul

The Lord haste the day, When thy faith shall be sight, 
The sky will roll back as a scroll, The trump shall resound 
And the Lord shall descend, Even so it is well with my soul.

But Lord �tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait, 
The sky, not the grace is our goal, Oh, the trump of the Angel! Oh! Voice of the Lord, Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul.

589.
Oh! Happy day that fixed my choice, 
On Thee my Saviour and my God!   Well may this glowing heart rejoice, And tell its raptures all abroad,

 Happy day, happy day, When Jesus washed my sins away!
 He taught me how to watch and pray,                 
 And Live rejoicing ev�ry day, Happy day, happy day,    
 When Jesus washed my sins away!

Oh! Happy bond, that seals my vows, 
To Him who merits all my love; Let cheerful anthems fill His 
While to that sacred shine I move.                           [house,

�Tis done, the great transaction�s done, 
I am my Lord�s and He is mine, he drew me and I followed on, 
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

Now rest, my long-divided heart, 
Fixed on this blissful center, rest,  Nor ever from Thy Lord 
With Him of every good possessed,                            [depart,

High Heaven, heard that solemn vow, 
That vow renewed shall daily hear Till in life�s latest hour I bow 
And bless in death a bond so dear. 

590.
I need thee every hour, Most gracious Lord,
No tender voice like Thine can peace afford.

I need Thee, Oh! I need Thee; Every hour I need Thee,
Oh! Bless me now, my Saviour!  I come to Thee. 

I need Thee every hour, Stay Thou near by; 
Temptations lose their power, When Thou art nigh.

     I need Thee every hour, In joy or pain, 
     Come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

I need Thee every hour, teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises in me fulfill.

     I need Thee every hour, Most Holy One,
     Oh! Make me Thine indeed, Thou blessed Son.

591.
I am Thine oh! Lord, I have heard Thy voice 
And it tell Thy love to me, but I long to rise 
In the arms of faith, And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me nearer (3)  blessed Lord, 
To the cross where Thou hast died,
Draw me nearer (3)  blessed Lord, 
To Thy precious bleeding side.

Consecrate me now to Thy service Lord, 
But the power of grace divine, Let my soul look up 
with a steadfast hope, And my will be lost in Thine

Oh! The pure delight of a single hour, 
That before Thy throne I spend, When I kneel in prayer 
And with Thee my God, I commune as friend with friend

There are depths of love that I cannot know, 
Till I cross the narrow sea,  There are heights of joy
That I may not reach, Till I rest in peace with Thee.


592.
There shall be showers of blessing, this is the promise of love
There shall be seasons refreshing, sent from the Saviour above

  Showers of blessing,  Showers of  blessings we need,
  Mercy drops round us are falling but for the showers we plead

There shall be showers of blessing, Precious reviving again,
Over the hills and the valleys, Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of blessing, send them upon us O! Lord,
Grant to us now a refreshing; come & now honour now Thy Word.

There shall be showers of blessing, O! that today they might fall
Now as to God we�re confessing, Now as on Jesus we call!

593.
How I praise Thee, precious Saviour, 
That Thy love laid hold of me, Thou hast sav�d and 
Cleans�d and fil�d me, That I might Thy channel be

   Channels only, blessed Master, 
   But with all Thy wondrous power,  Flowing through us, 
   Thou canst use us,  Every day and every hour.

Just a channel, full of blessing,  To the thirsty hearts around,  To tell out Thy full salvation, All Thy loving message sound.

Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me, A clean vessel in 
Thine hand, With no power but as Thou givest, 
Graciously with each command.

Witnessing Thy power to save me, 
Setting free from self and sin, Thou hast bought me 
To possess me, In Thy fullness Lord, come in.

Jesus fill now with Thy Spirit, Hearts that full surrender know That the streams of living water From our inner man may flow
594.
I have found a friend in Jesus, He is everything to me,
He�s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul, 
The Lilly of the Valley, In Him alone I see 
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.

  In sorrow He�s my comfort in trouble He�s my stay,   
  He tells me every Care on Him to roll,  He is the 
  Lilly of the Valley, The bright and morning star, 
  He is the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

He all my grief has taken, And all my sorrows borne,
In temptation He�s my strong and mighty tower, 
I�ve all for Him forsaken, I�ve all my idols torn, 
From my heart & now He keeps me by His power, 
Though all the world forsake me and Satan tempt me sore, 
Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal,  He is..

He�ll never, never leave me, Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith and do His blessed will; 
A wall for fire about me, I have nothing now to fear, 
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.
When crowned at last in glory, I�ll see His blessed face, Where rivers of Delight shall ever roll.  He is the  ��.

595.
Jesus lover of my soul, Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll, While the tempest still is high,
Hide me O! My Saviour hide, till the storm of life be past
Safe into the haven guide, Oh! Receive my soul at last.

Other refuge have I none, Hangs my helpless Soul on Thee
Leave, Ah! Leave me not alone, Still support and comfort me;
All my trust on Thee is stay�d, All my help from Thee I bring; Cover my defenseless head, with the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, Oh! Christ, art all I want; More than all in Thee I find,
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, Heal the sick & lead the blind
Just and holy is Thy name, I am all unrighteousness;
Vile and full o sin I am, Thou art full of truth & grace.

Plenteous grace with Thee is found, Grace to cover all my sin, Let the healing streams abound, Make and keep me pure within, Thou of life the fountain art, Freely let me take of Thee, Spring Thou up within my heart, 



596.
More about Jesus would I know, 
More of His grace to others show,
More of His saving fullness see, 
More of His love who died for me.

   More more about Jesus, (2)
   More of His saving fullness see, 
   More of His love who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn, More of His holy will discern,
Spirit of God my teacher be, showing the things of Christ to me

More about Jesus in his word, holding communion with my Lord
Hearing His voice in every line, 
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus on His throne, Riches in glory all His own, More of His kingdom�s sure increase, 
More of His coming, prince of peace

597.
What a friend we have in Jesus, All our sins & grieves to bear! What a privilege to carry, Everything to God in prayer!  
Oh what peace we oft�n forfeit, Oh what needless pain we bear All because we do not carry, Everything to Lord in Prayer.

Have we trials and temptations?  Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged, Take it to the Lord in prayer 
Can we find a friend so faithful, 
Who will all our sorrows share? Jesus knows our every weakness, Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy-laden, Cumbered with a load of care? Precious Saviour, still our refuge, Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? 
Take it to the Lord in prayer, In His arms 
He�ll take and shield thee Thou wilt find a solace there.

598. 
Abide with me, Fast falls the eventide, The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide, When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, Oh! Abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life�s little day,
Earth�s joys grow dim, its glories pass away,
Change and decay in all around I see
Oh! Thou who changest not, abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour,
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter�s Power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Oh! Abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless, Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness; Where is death�s sting? Where, grace, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Reveal Thyself before my closing eyes,
Shine through the bloom and point me to the skies,
Heaven�s morning breaks, and earth�s vain shadows flee, 
In life, in death, Oh! Lord, abide with me.

599.

And can it be that I should gain, An interest in the 
Savior�s blood?  Died he for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued? Amazing love!
How can it be that Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

�Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies: Who can explore His
strange design?  In vain the first-born seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine! �Tis mercy all!
Let earth adore, Let angel minds inquire no more.

He left His Father�s throne above, So free so infinite His grace Emptied Himself of all but love & bled for Adam�s helpless race �Tis mercy all! Immence & free, for Oh my God, it found out me

Long my imprisoned spirit lay, Fast bound in sin and 
Nature�s night, Thine  eye diffused a quickening ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light; my chains fell off
My heart was free, I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.

No condemnation now I dread, Jesus and all in Him is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head, 
And clothed in righteousness divine, Bold I approach the 
Eternal Throne, and claim the crown through Christ my own.

601.
I have a song I love to sing, Since I have been redeemed, 
Of my Redeemer Saviour King, Since I have been redeemed
 
   Since I have been redeemed (2) I will glory in His name,
   Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in my Savior�s name

I have a Christ that satisfies, since I have been redeemed, 
To do His will my highest prize, Since I have been redeemed

I have a witness bright & clear, since I have been redeemed  Dispelling every doubt & fear, Since I have been redeemed

I have a home prepared for me, since I have been redeemed, Where I shall dwell eternally, Since I have been redeemed.

602.
     You alone are my mountain of hope, 
     Lord my God, forever you will be there.

You are the root cause for all- the heavens and the earth, Since I have my confidence in Thee, All my worries went afar,

You keep my legs from falling, and You carry me safely, By giving grace and being my helper, You lead me wonderfully, 

I�ll lift my eyes and behold, for Your kindness Oh! my Lord, 
Granting goodness in abundance, You will bless me forever, 

Even though my flesh dissolve - in soil or �am alive,  
When you will come, I�ll join with you and I�ll cheer in delight

603.
Sweet hour of prayer (2),That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father�s throne,  Make all my wants and Wishes known;  In seasons of distress & grief, 
My soul has often found relief, And oft escaped 
The tempter�s snare, By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer (2) Thy wings shall my petition bear,
To Him whose truth and faithfulness,  Engage the waiting 
Soul to bless, And since he bids me seek His face, 
Believe His word and trust His grace, I�ll cast on Him 
My every care, And wait for thee, Sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer (2), May I Thy consolation share,
Till from Mount Pisgah�s lofty height, I view my home and Take my flight, This robe of flesh I�ll drop and rise 
To seize the everlasting prize, And shout while passing Through the air, Farewell (2) sweet hour of prayer.

604.
Great is Thy faithfulness, Oh! God my Father,
There is no shadow of Turning with Thee,
Thou changest not, Thy compassion they fail not,
As Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be.

Great is Thy faithfulness (2) Morning by morning new mercies I see, All I have needed Thy hand hath provided, 
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me.

Summer and winter and spring time and harvest, 
Sun moon and stars In their courses above, 
Join with all nature in manifold witness,
To Thy great faithfulness mercy and love.

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth, 
Thy own dear presence to Cheer and to guide, Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside.

And purchased my pardon on Calvary�s Tree,

I would love Thee in life, I would love Thee in death, 
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath, 
And sing, when the death�s dew lie cold on my brow - its

And when the bright morn of Thy glory shall come, 
And the children ascend to the Father�s glad home, 
I�ll shout, with Thy likeness impressed on my brow ..its

I have lived a life of sin, In this world I am living in,
I have done forbidden things, I shouldn�t do,
I asked a beggar along the way, he could tell me where to stay 
Where I could find real happiness And love that�s true,

         Across the bridge, there is no more sorrow,
         Across the bridge, there is no more pain,
         The sun will shine across the river,
         And you will never be unhappy again.

Follow the footsteps of the king, Till you hear the voices ring, They will be singing of the glory of the lamb,
The river Jordan shall be nil, You�ll hear the trumpet sound, And you�ll behold the most precious places ever known to man

All the way my Saviour leads me, What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy, 
Who through life has been my Guide? Heavenly peace, divinest comfort, Hear by faith in Him to dwell!
For I know whate�er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well.

All the way my Saviour leads me, Cheers each winding path 
I tread,Gives me grace for every trial, Feeds me with the living bread,  Though my weary steps may falter,  
And my soul a thirst may be,
Gushing from the rock before me, Lo! A spring of joy I see.

All the way my Saviour leads me, Oh! He fullness of His love! Perfect rest to me is promised, In my Father�s house above.
When my spirit, clothed immortal, Wings its flight to realms of day, This my song through endless ages, 
Jesus, lead me all the way.

610.
Who can cheer the heart like Jesus, 
By His presence all divine?  True and tender, 
Pure and precious, Oh! How blest to call Him mine!

     All that thrills my soul is Jesus,  He is more than life to me    
    And the fairest of Ten thousand, In my blessed Lord I see.

Love of Christ so freely given, Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven, deeper than the deepest sea

What a wonderful redemption! Never can a mortal know,
How my sin though red like crimson, 
Can be whiter than the snow.

Every need His hand supplying, Every good in Him I see, 
On His strength Divine relying,  he is all in all to me.

By the crystal flowing river, With the ransomed I will sing,
And for ever and forever, Praise and glorify the King.

611. 
Sing them over again to me Wonderful words of Life;
Let me more of their beauty see Wonderful words of Life;
Words of life and beauty, Teach me faith and duty,

  Beautiful words, wonderful words, wonderful words of Life (2)

Christ the blessed One gives to all, wonderful words of life
Sinner list to the loving call, Wonderful words of life
All so freely given, wooing us to heaven �. Beautiful �

Sweetly echo the gospel call, Wonderful words of life
Offer pardon and peace to all, Wonderful words of life
Jesus only Saviour, Sanctify for-ever �. Beautiful �.
612.
With harps and with vials There stands a great throng,               
In the presence of Jesus, and sing this new song

   Unto Him who hath loves us,  And wash�d us form sin,
   Unto Him be the glory forever, Amen.

All these once were sinners, Defiled in His sight, 
Now arrayed in pure garments in praise they unite.

He maketh the rebel a priest and a king, 
He hath bought us and taught us this new song to sing.

How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been,   
If he never had loved us till Cleansed form our sin.

Aloud in his praises our voices shall ring,
So that others, believing, This new song shall sing.


613.
There is a fountain filled with blood, 
Drawn from Immanuel�s veins, And sinners plunged 
Beneath that flood, Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see That fountain in his day, 
And there may I, though vile as hem, Wash all my sins away.

Dear dying Lamb thy precious blood, shall never lose its pow�r
Till all the ransomed Church of God Be saved to sin no more.

E�er since by faith I saw the stream, Thy flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has Been my theme, And shall be till I die.

Then, in a nobler, sweeter song, I�ll sign Thy power to save, When this poor lisping stammering tongue lies silent in the grave

614.
Joyful, Joyful we adore Thee, God of glory, Lord of love, 
Hearts unfold like flower�s before Thee, 
Center of unbroken praise
Melt the clouds of sin & sadness, drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness, Fill us with Thy light of day.

All thy works with joy surround Thee, Earth and hev�n reflect Thy rays, Stars and angels sing around Thee, 
Center of unbroken praise, 
Field &  forest vale & mountain, flowery meadow flashing sea, 
Chanting bird and flowing fountain Call us to rejoice in Thee.

Mortals join the mighty chorus which the morning stars began, Father love is reigning o�er us, Brother love binds man to man, 
Ever singing march we onward, Victors in the midst of strife,
Joyful music leads us sunward In the triumph song of life.

615. 
I gave my life for Thee, My precious blood I shed
That thou might ransomed be, And quickened from the dead, 
I gave I gave my life for thee, What hast thou given for Me?

My Father�s house of light, My glory circled throne,  
I left for earthly night, for wanderings sad and lone;    
I left I left it all for thee, Hast thou left aught for Me?

I suffered much for thee, more than thy tongue can tell, 
Of bitterest agony, to rescuer thee from hell;   I�ve borne, 
I�ve borne it all for thee, What hast thou borne for Me?

And I have brought to thee, Down for my home above, Salvation full and free, My pardon and My love, 
I bring I bring rich gifts to thee, What hast thou brought to Me?

616. 
On a hill far away stood and old rugged cross, 
The emblem of suffering and shame, 
And I love That old cross, Where the dearest and the best 
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I�ll cherish the old rugged cross, Till my trophies at last I lay down, I will cling to the Old rugged cross, 
And exchange it someday for a crown.

Oh! The old rugged cross, so despised by the world, 
Has a wondrous attraction for me, For the dear lamb of God Left His glory above, To bear it to dark Calvary 

In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, 
A wondrous beauty I see, For �twas on that old cross, 
Jesus suffered and died To pardon and sanctify me�

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true, Its shame and reproach gladly bear, Then He�ll call me some day, 
To my home far away, Where His glory for ever I�ll share.

617. 
Lead kindly light, amidst encircling gloom, Lead Thou me on The night is dark and I�m far from home, Lead Thou me on,
Keep Thou my feet, I do not ask to see,
The distant scene-One step enough for me.

I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou should lead me on, I loved to choose and see my path,  but now lead Thou me on
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.

So long Thy pow�r hath blest me, Sure it still Will lead me on, O�er moor and fen, o�er crag and torrent, Till the
night is gone and with the morn those angel faces smile
Which I have loved long since, and lost a while.

618. 
Hark the herald angels sing, Glory to the new born King,
Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled!
Joyful all ye nations rise, Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem.
Hark the herald angels sing, Glory to the new born King.

Christ, by highest heaven adored, Christ, the everlasting Lord,
Late in time behold him come, Offspring of a virgin�s womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see! Hail the incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with man to dwell, Jesus, our Immanuel.
Hark! The herald angels sing, Glory to the new born King.

Hail the heaven-born prince of peace! 
Hail, the Sun of righteousness,  
Light and life to all He brings, Risen with healing in his wings
Mild, He lays His glory by; Born that men no more may die;
Born to rise the sons of earth, Born to give them second birth
Hark! The herald angels sing, Glory to the new born King.


619.
I serve  a risen Saviour who�s in the world today
I know He is living whatever men may say, 
I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer
And just the time I need Him He�s always near.

   He lives, he lives, Christ Jesus lives today!  
   He walks with me and talks with me along life�s narrow way,   
    He lives, he lives, salvation to impart! 
   You ask me how I know He lives? He lives within my heart.

In all the world around me, I see His loving care, 
And tho� my heart grows weary, I never will despair, 
I know that He is leading thro� all the stormy blast, 
The day of His appearing will come at last,

Rejoice rejoice oh! Christian Lift up your voice and sing,  
Eternal halleluyyas to Jesus Christ the King!   
The hope of all who seek Him The help of all who find, 
None other is so loving, So good and king.      

620.
Jesus is coming! Sing the glad word, 
Coming for those who redeemed by His blood, 
Coming to reign as the Glorified Lord, Jesus is coming again.

Jesus is coming, is coming again! Jesus is coming again, 
Oh shout the glad tidings Over mountain & plain, Jesus is....

Jesus is coming, the dead shall arise,  Loved ones shall meet in a joyful surprise, Caught up together to Him in the skies �

Jesus is coming His saints to release, Coming to give to the
Warring earth peace! Sinning & sighing & sorrow shall cease

621.
Break Thou the bread of life, Dear Lord to me,
As Thou didst break the bread, Beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page, I seek Thee, Lord,
My spirit longs for Thee, Thou Living Word.

Thou are the Bread of Life, Oh! Lord to me, Thy holy Word the truth, That saveth me; Give me to eat and live, with Thee above, Teach me to love Thy truth, for Thou art love.

Oh! Send Thy Spirit Lord, now unto me,
That He may teach my eyes, And make me see;
Show me the truth concealed, Within Thy Word,
And in Thy Book revealed, I see Thee, Oh! Lord.

Bless Thou the Bread of Life, To me, to me, As Thou didst bless the loaves, By Galilee; Then shall all bondage cease, All fetters fall, And I shall find my peace, My all in all.

622.
A pilgrim was I and a  wand �ring,  In the cold night of sin 
I did roam. When Jesus the kind shepherd found me, 
and now I am on my way home

  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me, 
  All the days, All the days of my life. (2)
  And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever 
  And I shall feast at the table Set for me, �. Surely ..
         
He restoreth my soul when I�m weary, He giveth me strength day by day, He leads me beside the still waters, 
He guards me each step of the way.

When I walk thru; the dark lonesome valley, 
My Saviour will walk with me there,  And safely His great hand will lead me,  To the mansion He�s gone to prepare.

623.
Joy to the world!  the Lord is come, Let earth receive her King, Let every heart prepare Him room, And heave�n & Nature sing, (2) And heav�n & Hev�n & nature Sing.   

Joy to the earth! The Saviour reigns; 
Let men their songs employ, While the fields and floods, rocks, hills &  plains Repeat the sounding joy, 
Repeat the sounding joy, Repeat, Repeat the sounding joy,

No more let sins and sorrows grown,  
Nor thorns in-fest the ground,  He come to make His blessings flow,  Far as the curse is found, 
Far as the crust is found, Far as far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace, And makes
The nations prove the glories of His righteousness, 
And wonders of His love, (2) And wonders (2) of His love.

624. 
Oh! Spread the tidings �round, wherever man is found
Where ever human heart and human woes abound, 
Let every Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound:

The comforter has come! (3) The Holy ghost from heav�n, The father�s Promise giv�n, O spread the tiding �round, 
Wherever man is found�The comforter has come

The long long night is past, the morning breaks at last, 
And hushed the dreadful wail and fury of the blast, 
As o�er the golden hills the day advances fast!

Lo, the great King of kings, with healing in His wings, 
To every captive soul a full deliverance brings, 
And through the vacant cells the song of triumph rings 

Oh! Boundless love divine! How shall this tongue of mine, To wond'ring mortals tell the matchless grace divine-That I a child of hell, Should in His image shine!

625.
Crown Him with many crowns, The Lamb upon His throne,
Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns, all music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing, of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King, Through all eternity.

Crown Him the Lord of life, Who triumphed O�er the grave,
And rose victorious in the strife, For those He came to save,
His glories now we sing, Who died and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring, And lives that death may die.

Crown Him the Lord of Love, Behold His hands and side,
Those wounds yet visible above, In beauty glorified:
No angel in the sky, can fully bear the sight, 
But downward bends His burning eye, At mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of peace, Whose power a scepter sways,
From pole to pole that wars may cease & all be prayer & praise
His reign shall know no end, And round His pierced feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend, Their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown Him the Lord of years, The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres, Ineffably sublime!
All hail, Redeemer, hail! For Thou hast died for me,
Thy praise shall never, never fail, throughout eternity.

626.
Praise the Saviour, ye who know Him!
Who can tell how much we owe Him?
Gladly let us render to Him
All we are and have.

Jesus is the Name that charms us,
He for conflict fits and arms us,
Nothing moves and nothing harms us,
When we trust in Him.

Trust in Him, ye saints, forever;
He is faithful, changing never;
Neither force nor guile can sever
Those He loves from Him.

Keep us Lord, O keep us cleaving,
To Thyself and still believing,
Till the hour of our receiving
Promised joys in heaven.

Then we shall be where we would be,
Then we shall be what we should be,
That which is not now, nor could be,
Then shall be our own.

627.
�Must I go - and empty handed?�
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?

    �Must I go - and empty handed?�
     Must I meet my Saviour so?
    Not one soul with which to greet Him?
    Must I empty handed go?

Not at death I shrink or falter,
For my Saviour saves me now:
But to meet Him empty � handed
Thought of that now clouds my brow.

Oh, the years of sinning wasted!
Could I but recall them now
I would give them to my Saviour
To His will I�d gladly bow.

Up, ye saints, arouse, be earnest!
Up and work while yet �tis day;
Ere the night of death o�ertake you,
Strive for souls while yet you may.

628.
Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin;
Each victory will help you some other to win;
Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue,
Look ever to Jesus, He�ll carry you through.

       Ask the Saviour to help you,
       Comfort, strength and keep you
       He is willing to aid you,
       He will carry you through.
Shun evil companions, bad language disdain,
God�s name hold in reverence, nor take it in vain;
Be thoughtful and earnest, kind � hearted and true,
Look ever to Jesus, He�ll carry you through.

To him that o�ercometh God giveth a crown,
Through faith we shall conquer,
Though often cast down;
He, who is our Saviour, our strength will renew;
Look ever to Jesus He�ll carry you through.

629.
Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel � feet have trod;
With its crystal tide for ever
Flowing by the throne of God?

       Yes, we�ll gather at the river,
       The beautiful, the beautiful river
       Gather with the saints at the river
       That flows by the throne of God.

On the margin of the river 
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever
All the happy, golden day.

Ere we reach the shinning river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

At the shinning of the river,
Mirror of the Savior�s face,
Saints whom death will never sever
Raise their songs of saving grace.

Soon we�ll reach the silver river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace.



630.
God be with you till we meet again!....
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you till we again!

    Till we meet!...... Till we meet!....
    Till we meet at Jesus� feet;�..
    Till we meet!...... Till we meet!....
    God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!
�Neath His wings  securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!
When life�s perils thick confound you,
Put His loving arms around you;
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!
Keep love�s banner floating o�er you,
Smite death �s threatening wave before you;
God be with you till we meet again!

631.
In all this world so big and wide
No mortal that I know
Is strong enough to halt the time
Or make a flower grow?
But someone made the mountains tall
And all the oceans full
Who is the Master of it all?
It�s bound to be the Lord.

       It takes somebody strong and tall
       To hand the stars so high
       Or paints the morning sky
       Or make the sparrow fly
       There is an answer to it all
       And if you�ve never heard 
       Don�t ever doubt my word
      It�s bound to be the Lord

I know exactly who it is
That spreads the morning dew
And breaks the world with loveliness
And make the sky so blue
And if you doubt that I am right
Just reads God�s holy word
The answer�s there in black and white
It�s bound to be the Lord.

632
Forgive Oh Lord and heal our land
Give us eyes to seek Your face
And hearts to understand
That You alone make all things new
And the blessing of the land we love
Are really gifts from You 
    
      If my people will humbly pray
      And seek my face and turn away
      From all their wicked ways 
      Then I will hear them and move my hand
      And freely then will I forgive 
      And I will heal their hand

Unite our hearts in one accord
And make us hungry for your peace
And burdened for the lost
And grant us hope that we might see
A future for the land we love 
And grant us hope that we might see
A future for the land we love our life, our liberty.

633.
A parade began at Calvary
The saints of all the ages fill it�s ranks
For the sands of time they�re marching
To their King�s great coronation
And this could be the dawning of that day

     This could be the dawning
     Of that grand and glorious day
     When the face of Jesus we behold
     Dreams and hopes of all the ages
     Are awaiting His returning 
     And this could be the dawning of that day.

All the saints are getting restless 
Not bound my shakles, forged of earthly gold
Since that day they knelt at Calvary
They�ve been pilgrims ever wandering 
Just looking for a place to rest their souls

Br. Until then my heart will go on singing
Until then with joy I�ll carry on
Dreams and hopes of all the ages
Are awaiting His returning
And this could be the dawning of that day.
634.
Depth of mercy can there be
Mercy still reserved for me
Can my God Your wrath forbear
Me the chief of sinners spare

       It�s my only hope
       You�re my only hope 
       It�s my only hope of heaven at the Cross forgiven 

I have long withstood Your grace
Long provoked You to Your face
With my heart into Your calls 
Grieved to die a thousand falls

Br.  And there for me the Saviour stands
       Shows His wounds and spreads His hands
       Face to face before the Son like I�ve said I am undone
       
Depth of mercy vast and free
So much deeper than the sea
God of love You heard my cry
Now into Your own arms I fly

635.
There is a candle in every soul;
Some brightly burning, some dark and cold;
There is a Spirit who brings a fire;
Ignities the candle and makes His own.

    Carry your candle run through the darkness;
    Seek out the hopeless confused and torn
     Hold out your candle for all to see it
    Take your candle, go light your world.

Rush to your brother see how he is tried to;
Light his own candle some other way.
See now your sister she�s been robbed and lied to
Still holds her candle without a flame.
We are a family we stand united
Let�s raise our candles light up the sky
Bring to your Father in the name of Jesus 
Make us to shine in the darkest hours.

636.
Come ye sinners, lost and lonely
Jesus� blood can make you free
For He saves the worst among you
When he saved a wretch like me
    
      And I know, yes I know
      Jesus� blood can make the vilest sinners clean

To the faint He giveth power 
Through the mountains makes a way
Findeth water in the desert
Turns the night into golden day
In temptation He is near thee
Hold the powers of hell at bay
Guides you to the path of safety
Gives you grace for everyday

637.
You say you�ve tired of wrestling
With your pillow till the dawn
There�s an hurting heart that hid,
Behind the smile your putting on
To and fro and far and wide you only found it in
There�s one door you�ve not opened yet
Turn around and walk on in

    He is the fountain of living water
     Bright and morning star
     Shepherd that never leaves the sheep
     But knows just where you are
     The lilly in your darkest valley
     That light that got you home
     He said I am the way, to life I am the door.

Know is hard to comprehend how easy it can be
To find what you�ve been looking for by simple sinners plea
Jesus stands just right outside,
Your Home He will restore
He waits for you to make the move and open up the door.

638.
Lord God of Abraham
God of this whole wide world 
Maker of earth, the sun, the noon and the stars
We are the fruits of Your love
And for our sakes You left Your throne
To shed us Your blood soul cleansing blood 
Upon that cross

   Hear our prayers Oh Lord
   As we kneel at Your throne of grace
   Help us to live by faith
  And show us Your way
  Every step we take
  Every move we make
  Be Thou our God
  Be as our God and guide

Sometimes our way is drift
Without a ray of cheer
When shadows of grief they linger over our souls
When vile says go and hope goes down
The world says go and grave says gone
Oh take us Lord Jesus to the bright lights
Beyond that shore.

639.
While upon this earth below
I strived to do my best
Many times I am tempted and many times put to the test
I�ve put my trust in God on Him I can depend 
He is closer than a brother He�s truer than a friend.

    And that�s the kind of love that make life worth living 
    And that�s the kind of love that makes a heart forgiving
    Upon the cross He died, for the world was crucified
    That�s the kind of love that makes life worth living.

Some folks don�t understand God�s love for fallen men
And why He sends His Son to die on Calvary
But God as He forseen
Read John 3:16 and then you�ll understand
God�s love for fallen man.

640.
 Through my disappointment, strife and discontentment
I pass my every care upon the Lord
No matter what obsession or pain or deep depression
I�m standing on the solid rock.

   I�m standing on the rock of ages 
   Safe from all the storm that rages
   I�m rich but not from Satan�s wages
   I�m standing on the solid rock

Even though He is gone now
I don�t feel alone now
With comfort came the Spirit of the Lord 
Now with His word to guide me
From temptations hide me
I�m standing on the solid rock.

641.
From the ends of the earth
From the depths of the seas
From the heights of the heavens
Oh Lord Your name we praise 
From the hearts of the weak
From the shouts of the strong
From the lips of all the people
Oh this song we raise Lord
Throughout the endless ages 
You will be crowned with praises Lord
Most High��. (Jesus)
Exalted in every nation, Lord
You�re the sovereign of all creation Lord
Most High
We magnify.

642.
Who holds the heavens in His hands
Who made the stars by the word of His power
Who put the Spirit in man
And causes all the earth to cry out glory.

    Glory to the Lord, worship Him
     The God of our salvation
     Glory to the Lord, honour Him
     He reigns, He rules the nations
     He is righteous and worthy 
     To be worshipped and adored
     Lift your voices and give
     Glory to the Lord.

Who hold the righteous by the hand
Who is the way in this marvelous hour
Who stirs the heart of a man
And causes all His saints to cry out glory.

643.
Here among the shadows living 
In a lonely land of strangers 
We�re band of pilgrims on the move
Turning down the sorrow
Sun on every land 
Looking for a city built above.

    Looking for a city 
    Where we�ll never die
    There the sainted millions 
     Never say goodbye
     There we�ll meet our Saviour 
     And our loved ones too
     Come oh Holy Spirit
     All our hopes renew.

In this land of danger
We are going here and there
We would be trusting in the blessed Savior�s blood
Knowing there�ll be strangers 
In this world of care
Looking for a city built above.

644.
Lord You are my refuge
You are my hiding place
Oh Lord You are my refuge
And I will rest in Your saving grace.

You are the Rock of my salvation
You are the One who calls us His won
Lord You set my feet on higher ground
I�ll worship and adore You
I�ll lift up my voice on high 
Only in Your presence
Will I find.

645.
The Nazarene had come to live
The life of every man
And He felt the fascination of the stars
And as He wandered through this weary world
He wondered and He wept for there was so 
Few who�d listen to His call
  
  He came, He saw, He surrendered all
  So that we might be born again
  And the fact of His humanity
  Was there for all to see
  He was unlike any other man
  And yet so much like me.

The Nazarene could hunger and 
The Nazarene could cry
And He could laugh with all the fullness
Of His heart
And those who hardly knew Him
And those who knew Him well
Could feel the contradiction from the start.


646.
There�s not a friend like the lowly Jesus,
No. not one! No, not one!
None else could heal all our soul�s diseases,
No, not one! No, not one!

      Jesus knows all about our struggles,
       He will guide till the day is done
There�s not a friend like the lowly Jesus
       No, not one! No, not one!

No friend like Him is so high and holy,
No, not one! No, not one!
And yet no friend is so meek and lowly
No, not one! No, not one!
There�s not an hour that He is not near us,
No, not one! No, not one!
No night so dark, but His love can cheer us,
No, not one! No, not one!

Did ever saint find this Friend forsake him?
No, not one! No, not one!
Or sinner find that He would not take Him?
No, not one! No, not one!

Was e�er a gift like the Saviour given?
No, not one! No, not one!
Will He refuse us a home in heaven?
No, not one! No, not one!

647.
It�s a good thing it�s a good thing 
To sing praises unto the King
It�s a good thing it�s a good thing 
It�s a good thing to sing praises  
Unto the King it�s a good thing

Bring Him glory He is King       
Bring Him honor let us sing
He is worthy all praise is His
Oh, how pleasant and fitting it is
It�s a good thing      (repeat chorus)

Hallelujah, He is King

To destroy the works - Of the evil one

And to rescue men - From the law and sin

To redeem a people - He calls His own
From every nation - Tongue and tribe
Purchased by the blood - He shed with love

And to raise again - And to conquer death
He�ll return like a thief - In the night
And He will reign on high - Forever with His bride
This is the gospel of Christ             (repeat chorus 4 times)

There is a voice that must be heard
There is a song that must be sung
There is a Name that must be lifted high
There is a treasure more than gold
There is a king upon the throne
There is One whose praise will fill the skies

       His Name is Jesus
       Friend of sinners
       Jesus, Jesus
       Friend of mine

There is a peace that calms our fears
There is a love stronger than death
There is a hope that goes beyond the grave
There is a friend who won�t let go
There is a heart that beats for you
There is one name by which we are saved
When I was captive to my fears
You were the one who came to me
You set me free.

I wandered in endless life filled with sin, 
I would let my dear say few things,
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night,
Praise the Lord I saw the light, I saw the light �

No more darkness, No more night, Now I am so happy 
No sorrow inside, Praise the Lord, I saw the light.

There is a land that is fairer than day, And by faith, 
We can see it afar For the Father waits over the way, 
To prepare us a dwelling place there

In the sweet by& by, We shall meet on that beautiful shore (2)

Some glad morning, when my life�s over, 
I will fly away To a home on God�s celestial shore, I will fly away, I�ll fly away, Oh! Glory, I will fly away, When I die, Haleluyya, by and by I�ll fly away

Yehova rafa vo hai thera, changai denai vala
Changa kartha hathom sai chukar aa thu uskai pass
Bahatha uska lahu krus kai thalai
Aaye job hi uskai pass, detha vah chutkara

Yehova shalom vo hai thera shanthi denai vala
Apanai aasisom sai vo bhartha therai jeevan ko
Mahasagar jaisee badhaom maim kholega dvar
Pap aur shrap hongai dur Yesu kai lahu sai

Yahova nissi vo hai thera vijay denai vala
Shathru therai kherai thuchko, thu na khabaranu
Dekh therai samnai Prabhu nai dai dee vijay
Chutkara keval Yeshu hee maim hai

Maim jeevan bhar Yehova kai geeth gatha rahum
Bana rahunga ju thak maim gaum uska bhajan
Prabhu kee seva karum jeb thak ho much maim jan
Chahai saree duniya karai mera apaman

794.
Prarthana maim jo kuch manga
Pura karo arman
Saree khathaem maaf karo
Thera karum ab dhyan

Dil maim dheemi aavaz aayee
Apanai gunahom ko man
Jan liya mainmnai aavaz uski
Jiska kiya apaman

Eeman laye thuch pai masiha
Aaye thumharai pass
Maff karo ab pap hamarai
Kar do lahum sai saff
